== MyPaint 1.1 ==
- Build into a static library instead of shared
- Implement support for "foreign" buffers in GeglSurface backend,
  that is buffers which are provided though set_buffer() and may
  not always have the ideal color format and tile size.

- Make sure copyright headers exists in all files
- Document the library concepts and API in the code. Import information from wiki
- Set up build of documentation. Import diagrams from doc/
- Document how install, lookup and modification of brush resources should happen

- Implement save/serialization of brushes to JSON
- Use the libmypaint load/save methods in MyPaint itself

- Tests and benchmarks suite.
 * Implement checks for correctness of rendering
 * Benchmarks should output the results as JSON

- Rename to "libmypaint" and install resources to "libmypaint" (not "mypaint")

== Later ==
- Use floats types instead of uint15/uint16
- Define that surfaces are in linear-light, not gamma-corrected.
 * Update shipped brushes to be adjusted for this.
 * Bump the brush version or otherwise annotate this change so that
   other applications can handle them?
